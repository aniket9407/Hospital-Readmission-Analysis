# Hospital Readmission Risk & Performance Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes hospital readmission patterns using real-world patient data to identify key factors influencing 30-day readmissions. The analysis was performed using SQL for data cleaning and transformation and Power BI for interactive visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Calculate overall 30-day readmission rate
* Identify high-risk patient segments
* Analyze impact of age, hospital stay duration, medication intensity, and emergency visits
* Provide insights for improving discharge planning and hospital efficiency

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Overall readmission rate: **11.16%**
* Long-stay patients show significantly higher readmission risk
* Patients with 3+ emergency visits have the highest readmission rate
* Moderate medication groups demonstrate elevated risk levels
* Elderly patients contribute most to operational burden due to high admission volume
